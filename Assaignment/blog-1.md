    Union type : union type allows to hold multiple value in one variable. It is useful when a variable have several possible value. we can create union type by using "|" operator.

    *****significance of union type*****
    1. Flexibility in Handling Multiple Types: By using union type it can flexible to handling multiple types.
    2. Improved Type Checking: Union type improve type checking. And it is easy to maintenance code for developer.
    3. Combining Types Dynamically: The Union type can provide dynamic variable to combine various types
    4. Better Handling of Optional or Multiple Formats: Provides multiple formats by using Union types.

    //code of union
    type FrontendDeveloper = 'fakibaz Developer' | 'Jonior Developer'
    type FullStackDeveloper = 'frontend Developer' | 'expert Developer'
    type Developer = FrontendDeveloper | FullStackDeveloper

    const newDeveloper : FrontendDeveloper ='Jonior Developer'

    type User ={
        name: string;
        email?: string;
        gender: "male" | "female";
        bloodCroup: "O+" | "B+" | "AB+"
    }
    const user1: User ={
        name: 'Abul',
        gender: "male",
        bloodCroup: "AB+"
    }




    Intersection: intersection types combine multiple types in one types. Basically Intersection types used for handling complex types where multiple types used in a single type. we can create Intersection type by using "&" operator.

    *****significance of intersection type*****
    1.Combining Multiple Types: It combines multiple types in one types
    2.Improved Reusability and Modularity: The Intersection types improved Reusability and Modularity.
    3.Managing Complex Data Structures:The Intersection types simplify Complex Data Structures. 
    4.Clear and Maintainable Code: The Intersection types can provide Clear and Maintainable Code.

    type FrontendEngineer = {
        skills: string[];
        designation1: 'Frontend engineer'
    }

    type BackendEngineer = {
        skills: string[];
        designation2: 'Backend engineer'
    }

    type FullStackEngineer = FrontendEngineer & BackendEngineer
    const fullStackEngineer : FullStackEngineer={
        skills:['HTML','CSS','EXPRESS'],
        designation1: "Frontend engineer",
        designation2:'Backend engineer'
    }
